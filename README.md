# Healthcare-Fraud-Detector
Build model classification model to predict Healthcare Fraud. Data contaion combinations of patients's information, medical conditions, healthcare provider information, inpatient, and outpatient claim record. 
# Introduction
According to the most recent Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program Annual Report (2019) Estimated fraud costs up to 10% of total healthcare expendeture worldwide. The fraud case impacts the increase in its main cost to everyone involved in the healthcare system and damages the long-term solvency of programs such as incurance services/health care plans in the community (Barranek, Action, & Services, 2018).

# Types of Healthcare Provider Fraud. Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of frauds by providers are:

Billing for services that were not provided.
Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service.
Misrepresenting the service provided.
Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually provided.
Billing for a covered service when the service actually provided was not covered.
Therefore, comprehensive synthesis and evaluation are critical to providing useful information and reliable evidence to decision makers. This project proposes fraud mitigation as well as to prevent financial loss for insurance companies and also for goverment.

# Objectives
This project use to predict whether a provider is potentially fraud or not and to find the reason behind it as well as to prevent financial loss.

# Project Description
This Project will build model classification to predict Healthcare Fraud. Data contain combinations of patient's information, inpatient, and outpatient claim record. We will use a binary classification model based on the claims filed by the provider to predict the provider is potentially fraudulent or not.
